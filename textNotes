What characteristics of a neuron's repnse predict the likelihood of their exhibiting environmental memory.
Use ML techniques to see which neuronal response characteristics are predictive of memory
Environmental activity can be predicted reasonably using baseline and visual activity.
This suggests that environmental memory is not a task specific epiphenomenon but possibly useful neuronal activity which may hel us process retinospatial signals.
